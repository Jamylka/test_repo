Why am I taking this course?
I am taking this course because I am looking for a career change. I am a Flight Attendant, and while I love what I do, it just isn't stimulating enough for me. 
I am in need of a career that challenges me daily. Web development is that career for me. I have been learning through codecademy to make sure this is something I am indeed passionate about and want to pursue. 
What I have learned from codeacedmy is that this career is perfect for me. The more I learn how to code, the more techniques I learn to solving certain problems, the more passionate I become about it. 

How do I see my life changing by learning web development?
I see my life changing by learning web development, by being able to use my creativity as well as using my mind daily to solve problems. The curiosity of wondering how a web page is functioning the way it is, 
or seeing an error on a live app/web page and knowing how to fix it is a major confidence boost. My life will change because I will be able to utilize that curioisity and fix issues that companies can't figure
out. 

Desribe my ideal career.
My ideal career is working for a company whose beliefs align with my own. I would love to work alongside a team who is always willing to help those around them improve. My ideal career is also
working in an office, with a creative setting. Idealy, I would love the option of working remotely from time to time. I plan on hosting workshops in the future for those who do not have the means
of entering a program.
