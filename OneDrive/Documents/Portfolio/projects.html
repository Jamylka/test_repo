                One of the best experiences of my life. To see a different culture & their everyday way of living felt like being a fish out of water. The people were incredibly helpful when it came to assisting with directions, even in explaining the menu and what is
                offered. I was so pleasently surpised to see others care for their community & enviornment in a place where the population is about 37,393,000 people. I hope you enoy the moments I captured and that it gives you a glimpse of the beauitful
                country I was blessed to experience in person. Here is my tokyo photo reel, enjoy!
